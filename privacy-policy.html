    <h1>Privacy Policy for Still Reader</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last updated:</strong> December 23, 2024</p>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Still Reader ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use the Still Reader Chrome extension.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>Still Reader is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal data necessary for the extension to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Theme selection (light/dark), font size preferences, and AI API configuration are stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. This data is never transmitted to external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Article Content:</strong> When you activate reader mode, the extension accesses the current webpage's content to extract and display articles. This content is processed entirely locally on your device and is never transmitted to external servers except when you explicitly use the AI summary feature with your own API keys.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage API. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Theme preferences (light/dark mode)</li>
        <li>Font size settings</li>
        <li>AI API configuration (your API keys and provider settings)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No data is transmitted to external servers except when you explicitly use the AI summary feature with your own API keys.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>If you choose to use the AI summary feature, you must configure your own API keys for services like OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Gemini, or custom API providers. When you use this feature:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your article content is sent directly to the AI provider you've configured</li>
        <li>Still Reader does not have access to your API keys or the content sent to these services</li>
        <li>Your API keys are stored locally on your device and are never shared with us</li>
        <li>You are subject to the privacy policies of the AI provider you choose to use</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Permissions and Their Use</h2>
    <p>Still Reader requires the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> Used to save your preferences (theme, font size, AI API configuration) locally on your device. This data never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Used to access the current tab's content when you explicitly activate reader mode. We only access content when you click the extension icon or use a keyboard shortcut.</li>
        <li><strong>host_permissions:</strong> Required to enable reader mode on any website you visit. Content scripts are only injected when you explicitly activate reader mode, not automatically.</li>
        <li><strong>scripting:</strong> Used to inject content scripts that extract article content and render reader mode. Scripts are only injected when you activate reader mode.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your data with third parties. All data remains on your device unless you explicitly use the AI summary feature with your own API keys, in which case your article content is sent directly to the AI provider you've configured.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage API. We do not maintain any servers or databases that store your information. Your API keys and preferences are encrypted by Chrome's storage system.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Still Reader is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the Chrome Web Store listing or via the project's GitHub repository.</p>

    <p><small>This privacy policy is effective as of December 23, 2024.</small></p>
